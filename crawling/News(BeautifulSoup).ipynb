      "The Ambassador Bridge, a crucial link between the U.S. and Canada, reopened late Sunday evening after police cleared remaining anti-Covid restriction protesters, ending an almost week-long blockade that snarled North America’s busiest trade route. \n",
      "Protestors against Covid-19 vaccine mandates block the roadway at the Ambassador Bridge border ... [+] crossing in Windsor, Ontario, Canada\n",
      "Normal transport across Ambassador Bridge—which links Detroit and Windsor, Ontario—resumed late Sunday night, according to the Canada Border Services Agency, which advised against “non-essential travel.” \n",
      "A Windsor police official said between 20 and 30 people had been arrested at the bridge and numerous vehicles seized after a judge authorized the removal of the protestors on Friday, according to Reuters.\n",
      "The force said “enforcement is ongoing in the demonstration area” early Monday morning and urged members of the public to keep avoiding the area.\n",
      "“There will be zero tolerance for illegal activity,” the police said on Twitter. \n",
      "$2.16 billion. That’s roughly how much cargo is usually carried across the Bridge in a six-day period, based on a Reuters estimate of around $360 million a day. The figure represents 25% of all trade between the U.S. and Canada.\n",
      "Other protests. Blockades like the one at Ambassador Bridge have cropped up across Canada, with one convoy having brought capital Ottawa to a near-standstill for almost three weeks. The Canadian protests have inspired similar “Freedom Convoys” around the world, including New Zealand, France, Belgium, \n",
      "As of Sunday morning, the protesters raised $9.3 million on GiveSendGo, a Christian crowdfunding site. The site, which protesters moved to after GoFundMe froze funds raised on their platform, was inaccessible and listed as “under maintenance” on Monday morning. According to DailyDot reporter Mikael Thalen, the site was reportedly hacked and the names of those who donated to the Freedom Convoy leaked. GiveSendGo could not be reached by Forbes for comment. \n",
